# traefik-demo

Following https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/quick-start/.

Curious to experiment whether I could use `traefik` to manage all ssl/load
balancing, and then just route to containers running on ECS, etc...

Tbd if I want traefik itself to run in a container or on an ec2 instance.
