# Learning Spark v2

Environment for working through Learning Spark v2.

Easiest way to unblock local development is to download the Spark/Hadoop tar
from https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html and then un-tar.
To keep from polluting local machine, doing in a VM. Likely it could also work
in a docker container, but not positive.

Should work out of the box w/ `vagrant up` and then
`/spark/spark-.../bin/pyspark`.
